# Bitraf Electronics Library (BEL)

This repository has a list of components available at Bitraf, 
all components are free to use for members. 
We strive to have the list of components found here available 
at all times, so members can use them in new designs.  

There is also a list of referece designs made in KiCad, such as step down converter, 
hello world blinky led based on STM32 uC, a USB hub etc. These are meant to be used 
as building blocks for ne designs for both members and others.
